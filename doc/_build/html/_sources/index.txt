Photometry Pipeline Documentation
=================================

Introduction
------------

The Photometry Pipeline (PP) is a Python software package for
automated photometric analysis of imaging data from small to
medium-sized observatories. It uses `Source Extractor`_ and `SCAMP`_
to register and photometrically calibrate images based on catalogs
that are available online; photometry is measured using Source
Extractor aperture photometry. PP has been designed for asteroid
observations, but can be used with any kind of imaging data.

Supported Observatories
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The pipeline is currently set up to work on data from the following
observatories/instruments (telescope identifiers are given in square brackets):

* CTIO/ANDICAM (CCD camera) [ANDICAM]
* DCT/LMI [DCTLMI]
* VATT/VATT4k [VATT4k]


If you would like to use the pipeline for other observatories, please
contact me.

.. _supported_catalogs:

Supported Reference Catalogs 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

PP is currently able to use the following catalogs for astrometric and
photometric calibration:

* SDSS-R9
* URAT-1
* 2MASS

If you are interested in using catalogs other than those listed,
please let me know.
